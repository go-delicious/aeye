**Concise Steps to Clone a Flutter App from Git and Build for iOS on macOS (Extra Beginner-Friendly Prerequisites)**


Before you can clone and build your Flutter app for iOS, you **must** set up your macOS machine with these tools.  This part is crucial, so follow these steps carefully:

  * **1. Install the Flutter SDK:**  This is the toolkit you need to build Flutter apps.

      * **Download from Official Website:**

          * Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.) on your Mac and go to:  [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.google.com/url?sa=E%26source=gmail%26q=https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)
          * Click the button to download the **Flutter SDK ZIP file** for macOS (choose the **Stable Channel** version for beginners).

      * **Extract the ZIP File:**

          * Once the download is finished, find the ZIP file (it will be named something like `flutter_macos_something.zip`, usually in your "Downloads" folder).
          * **Double-click the ZIP file to extract it.** This will create a folder named `flutter`.
          * **Choose a good location for the `flutter` folder.** Drag and drop the extracted `flutter` folder to a location on your Mac where you want to keep your development tools.  Good places are your "Documents" folder, your home directory (just drag it onto your user name in Finder's sidebar), or a new folder named "development" in your home directory.  **Remember where you put this `flutter` folder - you'll need this path in the next step\!**

      * **Add Flutter to your PATH (Environment Variable):** This makes it easy to run Flutter commands from your Terminal.

          * **Open Terminal:** Launch the Terminal application on your Mac.
          * **Find your Shell Config File:**  In Terminal, type: `echo $SHELL` and press Enter.  Note if it says `/zsh` or `/bash`.
              * **If it says `/zsh`:** You need to edit the `.zshrc` file.
              * **If it says `/bash`:** You need to edit the `.bash_profile` file.
          * **Open the config file in a text editor:**
              * **For `zsh`:** Type `open ~/.zshrc` and press Enter.
              * **For `bash`:** Type `open ~/.bash_profile` and press Enter.
          * **Add the Flutter PATH line:**  In the text editor, add this line to the *very end* of the file. **Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]` with the *actual* full path to the `flutter` folder you extracted.**
            ```bash
            export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]/bin"
            ```
              * *Example:* If you put the `flutter` folder in your "Documents" folder, the line might be: `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Documents/flutter/bin"`
          * **Save and Close:** Save the file in the text editor and close it.
          * **Apply the changes:** In Terminal, run: `source ~/.zshrc` (if you edited `.zshrc`)  or `source ~/.bash_profile` (if you edited `.bash_profile`).

      * **Verify Flutter Installation:**

          * In Terminal, type: `flutter --version` and press Enter.  You should see Flutter version information printed. If you get an error "command not found: flutter", double-check your PATH setup.
          * Also run: `flutter doctor` in Terminal.  This tool checks your setup.  **Focus on resolving any initial errors related to Flutter itself being missing or issues with your basic setup.**  We will address Xcode in the next step.

  * **2. Install Xcode:** This is Apple's development environment, needed to build iOS apps.

      * **Open the Mac App Store:**  Find the "App Store" app in your Dock or Applications folder and open it.
      * **Search for "Xcode":** In the App Store search bar, type "Xcode" and press Enter.
      * **Install Xcode:** Find "Xcode" (developer: Apple) in the search results and click "Get" then "Install".  **Xcode is a large download and installation - it will take a significant amount of time. Be patient\!** You'll need to sign in with your Apple ID if prompted.
      * **Launch Xcode Once:** After Xcode finishes installing, find the Xcode application in your Applications folder (or Launchpad) and **launch it once by double-clicking its icon.** This is important to complete Xcode's initial setup and install necessary components. You can close Xcode after it launches and completes any setup prompts.

  * **3. Run `flutter doctor` again to verify Xcode setup:**

      * Open Terminal again (if it's closed).
      * Run: `flutter doctor`
      * **Examine the output of `flutter doctor` carefully.**
          * **Look for the "\[✓\] Xcode" line.**  This should now be checked (✓) or mostly checked.
          * **If you see "\[\!\] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (\!)" or "\[✗] Xcode...", read the messages carefully.**  `flutter doctor` will often give you hints on how to fix Xcode-related issues (like running `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`). Follow those instructions if given.
          * **It's okay if `flutter doctor` still shows warnings or errors related to Android tools** at this stage – we are focusing on iOS build setup on macOS right now.

**Once you have completed all steps in "Prerequisites: macOS Machine Setup" and `flutter doctor` shows a reasonably healthy setup (especially for Flutter and Xcode), proceed to the steps below to clone and build your app.**

**Steps to Clone, Get Dependencies, and Build (from previous, balanced version - still valid):**

1.  **Open Terminal**
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory** (using `cd` command)
3.  **Clone Git Repository** (using `git clone <repository_url>`)
4.  **Change Directory to Project** (using `cd aeye`)
5.  **Get Flutter Dependencies** (using `flutter pub get`)  **(Don't forget\!)**
6.  **(Optional) Run Flutter Doctor**
7.  **Build and Run for iOS Simulator** (using `flutter run -d ios` or `flutter run`)
8.  **See App in iOS Simulator\!**
